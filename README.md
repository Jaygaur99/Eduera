## Steps followed to create the project
I researched over the domain.
Then I analyzed how should the portal work.
Then I started working on the project using *Python* and *Django* for the backend.
After completing the project locally I used *Postgres* connecter for django to connect to database.
Then I used azure cli to deploy the website.
